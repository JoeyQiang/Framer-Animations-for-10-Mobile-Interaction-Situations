# Framer-Animations-for-10-Mobile-Interaction-Situations

Animation is fast becoming a common element of interface design. But understanding how animations serve to improve the functions of graphical user interfaces, and not distract from them is not always clear.

As a UX designer who is very interested in motion design, I decided to explore the topic of making animation for user interface, hoping it can bring useful ideas to designers.
